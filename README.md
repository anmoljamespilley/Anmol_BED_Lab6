# Anmol_BED_Lab6 - College Fest Debate Event Registration

## Problem Statement

In the College fest, students want to manage registrations for a Debate event and keep track of student details based on the course. The goal is to create a table using Spring, MVC, and Hibernate ORM to perform CRUD operations on the table.

## Sample Table

| Student Id | FirstName | LastName | Course | Country    |
|------------|-----------|----------|--------|------------|
| 1          | Suresh    | Reddy    | B.Tech | India      |
| 2          | Murali    | Mohan    | B.Arch | Canada     |
| 3          | Daniel    | Denson   | B.Tech | New Zealand|
| 4          | Tanya     | Gupta    | B.Com  | USA        |

## Requirements

1. Insert new records into the table.
2. Update existing records in the table.
3. Delete existing records from the table.
4. Print all records from the table.
5. Implement a security layer with two roles: USER and ADMIN.
   - ADMIN has the privilege to perform all operations.
   - USER can view and save details.

**Make sure to replace user and pass in 'application.properties'<br>
**The project follows a standard structure.<br>
**Proper error handling is implemented.<br>
**The indentations are correct.<br>
**industry level new/advanced methods are used for better approach, yet keeping the project structure simple.<br>
**security config as required per ADMIN and USER roles.<br>
